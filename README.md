## About the Project

This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to explore:
- Patient demographics (age, gender, blood type, etc.).
- Length of stay and its relationship to billing amounts.
- Prevalence of medical conditions across different age groups.
- Gender distribution in medical conditions.
- Trends in billing amounts and other metrics.

Using Python and data visualization libraries, this analysis provides detailed insights into the healthcare data.

## Datasets Used
- Patient Data:
  Age, gender, blood type, and admission/discharge dates.
  
- Medical Data:
  Medical conditions and their frequency.

- Billing Data:
  Total billing amounts associated with each patient.

## Key Features

Population Analysis:
- Gender distribution across different medical conditions.
- Population pyramid for age group analysis.

Medical Insights:
- Top medical conditions among patients.
- Correlation between medical conditions and billing amounts.

Billing Analysis:
- Trends in billing amounts based on length of stay.
- Visualization of high-billing medical conditions.

Interactive Visualizations:
- Box plots, scatter plots, and pie charts for easy interpretation of data.

## Usage

Run the main script to generate insights and visualizations:
python app.py
